== Dice of Doom

Implementing the game from *Land of Lisp* in JS/Coffeescript/Node

=== play

Requires node => http://nodejs.org/
along with the coffeescript and underscore libraries.

These are easily installed with npm => http://npmjs.org/
$ npm install coffee-script && npm install underscore

then, run with the `coffee` command:
$ coffee src/dice_of_doom.coffee

=== todo

So far I've just implemented human vs. human play. I'm
essentially following along in order of the *Land of Lisp*
chapters.

Next is the basic computer AI. Then lazy evaluation. 
Then make it interface over HTTP and serve up HTML and SVG.
