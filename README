== Dice of Doom

Implementing the game from *Land of Lisp* in JS/Coffeescript/Node
pretty source code at: http://mjhoy.github.com/dice-of-caffeinated-doom/dice_of_doom.html

=== install

Requires node => http://nodejs.org/
and the following libraries:
  coffee-script
  underscore
  socket.io

These are easily installed with npm => http://npmjs.org/
$ npm install coffee-script && npm install underscore && npm install socket.io

Also requires that 

zepto.js
underscore.js 
raphael.js
backbone.js

all be present in public/ for the HTML version.

=== play

the command line:
$ coffee src/cli.coffee

the HTML server:
$ coffee src/server.coffee
then, browse to 127.0.0.1:8124

=== next

Better graphics. Indication of dice rolls. Multiplayer?

=== history 

v0.0.1
Basic human vs. human play.

v0.0.2
Basic computer AI.

v0.0.3
Lazy evaluation of game trees. Basic heuristics for AI game
board rating.

v0.0.4
Vry basic node server and client interface that is still
essentially text. Use socket.io for persistence.

v0.0.5
Slightly boring Raphael graphics. Use backbone.js for 
models and event handling on the client.

v0.0.6
More complex game rules. Multiple computer players.
Chance (dice-rolling) introduced, although no interface
yet.
