== Dice of Doom

An implementing the game found in *Land of Lisp* in coffeescript and node.js to
run in the browser.

(Land of Lisp, by Conrad Barski, is available at: http://landoflisp.com/)

This implementation uses a server/client architecture. A client connects to a
node.js/websockets server, which tells the client about the game board. The
client sends the user's moves as messages, and the server responds with the
result of the move. On the computer's turn, the computer uses simple AI to
calculate moves and sends them to the client.

The nature of websockets and evented handling in node mean that multiple
clients can be connected to the same server at once playing separate games.

Here is a screenshot of the game in a browser:

The source code is available in readable HTML:

=== Install

Requires node => http://nodejs.org/
and the following libraries:
  coffee-script
  underscore
  socket.io (version 0.7+)

These are easily installed with npm => http://npmjs.org/

$ npm install coffee-script underscore socket.io

Also requires that 

zepto.js
underscore.js 
raphael.js
backbone.js

all be present in public/ for the HTML version.

Run `$ make` to download these libraries.

=== play

Assuming that npm has installed into ./node_modules/...

the command line:
$ node_modules/coffee-script/bin/coffee src/cli.coffee

the HTML server:
$ node_modules/coffee-script/bin/coffee src/server.coffee

then, browse to 127.0.0.1:8124

=== next

Better graphics. Indication of dice rolls. Multiplayer?

=== history 

v0.0.1
Basic human vs. human play.

v0.0.2
Basic computer AI.

v0.0.3
Lazy evaluation of game trees. Basic heuristics for AI game
board rating.

v0.0.4
Vry basic node server and client interface that is still
essentially text. Use socket.io for persistence.

v0.0.5
Slightly boring Raphael graphics. Use backbone.js for 
models and event handling on the client.

v0.0.6
More complex game rules. Multiple computer players.
Chance (dice-rolling) introduced, although no interface
yet.
